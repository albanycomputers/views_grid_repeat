Views Grid Repeat
------------------------

Provides ability to put Views content in responsive columns using CSS3 Grid layout.

INTRODUCTION
------------

Allow designers to create a grid content without or without creating their own CSS.

The module creates a new Views Format to display content in a CSS3 Grid.  You can select either Fit or Fill see https://css-tricks.com/auto-sizing-columns-css-grid-auto-fill-vs-auto-fit/ 


You can set the width of the content and the minimum height of the content to help create a more balanced grid.  The content will automatically wrap based on the width of the region.  No need to use @media queries for different viewport widths.
